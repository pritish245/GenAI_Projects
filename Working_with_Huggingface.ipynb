    "## Introduction to Huggingface\n",
    "\n",
    "[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) is one of the most popular library for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It has revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence(AI) by providing a platform through which anyone can access the latest models in each of the domain like Computer vision, Natural Language Processing, Audio, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it's one of the most popular platform?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Huggingface, research in NLP was conducted in silos, and it was difficult for the community to access any of the latest models from the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models). Therefore, Huggingface has **democratized the research by giving users direct access to state-of-the-art models**. With its simple and intuitive API, Huggingface has made it easier than ever for researchers and developers to incorporate NLP models into their applications.\n",
    "Using its platform, you can easily download any model, fine-tune it, and create models for your custom task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's this notebook about?\n",
    "One of the most disruptive and innovative architecture in NLP is Transformer. A type of neural network architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks. Huggingface provides pre-trained transformer models that can be fine-tuned on specific tasks, as well as tools for training custom transformer models from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**:\n",
    "> In this notebook:\n",
    "1. You will explore the different features and functionalities of the Huggingface library.\n",
    "2. You will look into the different pipelines and demonstrate how to use them for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, text generation & named entity recognition.\n",
    "3. You will learn how to load a pre-trained transformer model to perform any NLP task.\n",
    "4. You will dissect the pipeline feature of Huggingface and customise it to process any input sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*So let's start our journey"

    "\n",
    "  -  `fine-tuned`: It means that the model has been trained on a specific task (in this case, sentiment analysis on the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)** dataset) after being pre-trained on a large corpus of text. Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt to the specific task it is being used for and improve its performance on that task."

    "The medical field is vast and complex, encompassing various specialties, treatments, and research areas. Medical professionals rely on accurate and up-to-date information to diagnose and treat patients effectively. One critical aspect of the medical domain is the use of electronic health records (EHRs), which store patient data, including medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory test results. EHRs facilitate the sharing of patient information among healthcare providers, improving the coordination of care and patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical research is another crucial component, with continuous advancements in understanding diseases, developing new treatments, and improving existing therapies. Clinical trials play a significant role in this process, testing the safety and efficacy of new drugs and medical devices. These trials are conducted in phases, starting with small groups of healthy volunteers and progressing to larger groups of patients. The results of clinical trials are published in medical journals and contribute to evidence-based medicine, guiding clinical practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical imaging is an essential diagnostic tool, including techniques such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. These imaging modalities help visualize the internal structures of the body, aiding in the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases. Radiologists, who specialize in interpreting medical images, play a vital role in patient care by providing accurate diagnoses and recommendations for further treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of medical treatments, pharmaceuticals are a cornerstone. The development of new drugs involves extensive research and testing to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Pharmacology, the study of drugs and their effects on the body, is a critical field that informs the development and use of medications. Pharmacists, who are experts in medication management, work closely with healthcare providers to ensure patients receive the correct medications and understand how to use them properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surgery is another critical area of medicine, with various specialties such as general surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, and cardiovascular surgery. Surgeons perform operations to treat injuries, diseases, and deformities, often using advanced techniques and technologies. Minimally invasive surgery, which involves smaller incisions and quicker recovery times, has become increasingly popular in recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventive medicine focuses on preventing diseases and promoting health through measures such as vaccinations, screenings, and lifestyle modifications. Public health initiatives aim to improve the health of populations by addressing factors such as nutrition, physical activity, and environmental health. Epidemiology, the study of disease patterns and causes in populations, is a key discipline in public health that helps identify risk factors and develop strategies to control and prevent diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mental health is an integral part of overall health, with conditions such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia affecting millions of people worldwide. Mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors, provide diagnosis, treatment, and support for individuals with mental health conditions. Psychotherapy, medication, and lifestyle changes are common approaches to managing mental health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration of technology in healthcare has led to significant advancements, such as telemedicine, which allows patients to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This has been particularly beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling continued access to care while minimizing the risk of infection. Health informatics, the use of information technology to manage and analyze health data, is another growing field that supports the efficient delivery of healthcare services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical education and training are essential for preparing healthcare professionals to provide high-quality care. Medical students undergo rigorous education and training, including classroom instruction, laboratory work, and clinical rotations. Continuing medical education (CME) ensures that healthcare providers stay current with the latest advancements and best practices in their fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethics in medicine is a fundamental consideration, guiding the conduct of healthcare providers and researchers. Ethical principles such as autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice ensure that patients are treated with respect and fairness. Informed consent, confidentiality, and the right to refuse treatment are critical aspects of medical ethics that protect patient rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the medical domain is a multifaceted field that encompasses patient care, research, diagnostics, treatments, and public health. Continuous advancements in medical science and technology drive improvements in patient outcomes and the overall quality of healthcare. Healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers work together to address the challenges and opportunities in this dynamic field, striving to enhance the health and well-being of individuals and communities.\n",

    "So far we have used pipeline with the model name to perform different NLP tasks like `text-classification`, `text-generation` & `fill-mask`. We understood that it automatically performs the necessary preprocessing, tokenization, and model inference steps for a given task.\n",

    "However, we are not aware of what's happening inside the pipeline object. How it does all this operation automatically?\n",
    "\n",

    "* A **tokenizer** : The tokenizer is responsible for converting raw textual input into tokens. It performs tokenization, which involves splitting the input text into smaller units called tokens. The tokenizer maps the tokens to their corresponding numerical representations, allowing the model to process them. Tokenization is a critical step in NLP, as it helps the model understand and process the text effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **model** : The model is the core component of the pipeline. It takes the tokenized input and makes predictions based on the task at hand. For example, in text classification, the model predicts the sentiment of the input sentences. The model has been trained on large amounts of data and has learned patterns and relationships to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Post-processing**: The pipeline may include some optional post-processing steps to enhance the model's output. This could involve converting the model's predictions into more human-readable formats, applying thresholding or normalization techniques, or performing any other necessary operations to refine the output..\n",
